Note: This is a work in progress project, not yet fully working<br><br>
A super cheap Digital Readout (DRO) for lathes, milling machines etc. using a esp32 based "cheap yellow display" (AKA ESP32-2432S028R) and cheap eBay digital calipers.<br>
You can pick up the display modules on Aliexpress for around £12 and calipers around £6 each.<br><br>
