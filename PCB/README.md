#PCB to interface the CYD to the digital calipers

<img src="circuit.jpg" />

The calipers operate at 1.5v so this is required to convert this to the 3.3v of the CYD.  It is a very simple circuit which uses a simple transistor to do this, I used my CNC router to cut a PCB but you could easily just build this on some strip board etc. I have seen others use the level shifters from eBay but I could not get mine to operate with the 1.5volts. <br>

I have included the Fritzing file of this circuit
